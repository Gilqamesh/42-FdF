# FdF
This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french,
hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points
(x, y, z) via segments.

Each number corresponds to a point in space:
• The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
• The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.
• The value corresponds to its altitude.

In this project specifically, its required to show the map using isometric projection.
